# Notion API
 My implementation of Notion API in PHP with no dependencies

## Installation & Use
git clone or download Notion.php then
```require_once path/to/dir/Notion.php```

The repository is created for use only on my website, therefore only API endpoints that I personally use are interfaced in this Notion class. Should you need to use a much better, project-agnostic API implementation, please take a look at [5am-code/laravel-notion-api](https://github.com/5am-code/laravel-notion-api)
